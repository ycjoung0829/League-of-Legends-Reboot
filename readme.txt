My term project is called ‘League of Legends 1v1.’ This project will be a simplified version of
League of Legends, which is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena video game. The objective is to
destroy the opponent’s Nexus, or base, before the opponent does after destroying the turrets. The main
interactions between the user and the project are that players have to move around with 'w','a','s','d', 
and auto-attack or use skills to kill the wave of minions, the enemy champion, the enemy turret, and ultimately, 
the enemy Nexus. 

The game can be run simply by running the python file 'run'. 

The only module that needs to be installed separately is the pygame module.

Basic controls:
'w', 'a', 's', 'd': champion moves up, left, down, right
mouse left click: if the items are clicked and the player has enough money, the items are bought and used.
mouse right click: if the minion or the AI is in range, the champion starts the autoattack.
'e': champion increases its speed temporarily
'q': champion's autoattacks have critical damage temporarily
'f': champion can burst-heal once throughout the game
